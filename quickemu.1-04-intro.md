## Introduction

Quickly create and run highly optimised desktop virtual machines for Linux,
macOS and Windows; with just two commands. You decide what operating system you
want to run and Quickemu will figure out the best way to do it for you. For
example:

```bash
quickget ubuntu-mate 22.04
quickemu --vm ubuntu-mate-22.04-.conf
```

The original objective of the project was to enable quick testing of Linux
distributions where the virtual machine configurations can be stored anywhere,
such as external USB storage or your home directory, and no elevated permissions
are required to run the virtual machines. **Quickemu now also includes
comprehensive support for macOS and Windows**.
